Put your custom songs here
It should be a folder with your custom song's name, and inside of it should include two files: "Inst.ogg" or "Inst.mp3" or "Inst.wav", and "Voices.ogg" or "Voices.mp3" or "Voices.wav"
NEW: if you want secret songs, add the folder with what we just told you inside it and drop it in mods/music/
